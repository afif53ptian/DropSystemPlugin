## Features
- Group the drop by name (so that you don't feel uncomfortable with the box drop on the screen)
- Right click on the drop name (in the main / pool column) for **Keep, Reject, Open on Wiki, Search on Wiki, Restore**
  - **Keep**: keep items in your inventory
  - **Reject**: reject / move items to the "drop pool" (a kind of recycle bin)
  - **Restore**: returns the drop from pool to main
  - **Open on Wiki**: open items in the wiki
  - **Search on Wiki**: search for items on the wiki (alternative, if the Open on Wiki doesn't exist)
  - **Restore**: move drop from pool to main
- **Hide Pool / Logs**: hide the drop pool column with logs
- **Refresh**: refresh the list of items that drop (for example, there is an error / blank)
- **Debug Logs**: check the plugin's condition (error / ga), there are also some messages for guidance
- **AutoAttack**: auto attack based on the input skill (can only be active when ingame)
## How To Use
1. Load Plugin from Grimorie 1.7.8
2. Enable plugin when your char is logged out (If ingame: plugin can't be enabled)
3. All drop boxes are blocked, the drop only appears in the plugin
4. When the drop is kept, the box will appear for a moment, then it disappears (if it doesn't disappear / fails, just click "No", the drop is still in the plugin, if the box doesn't appear it means the item is already in inventory)
5. If list suddenly goes blank, try clicking refresh and it'll back
6. Plugin Disable: you must logout first then disable the plugin
## Note
- I don't recommended to use it with a bot manager (but i already tested, and it's fine but maybe still buggy in some case)
