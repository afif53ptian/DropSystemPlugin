3. All drop boxes are blocked, the drops only appears in the plugin
4. When the drop is kept, the box will appear for a moment, then it disappears (if it doesn't disappear / fails, just muanually click "No" and the drop is still on the plugin, if the box doesn't appear it means the item is already in inventory)
